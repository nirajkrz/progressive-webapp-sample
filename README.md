This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.
It is a POC for understanding the concept of PWA( Progressive Web app).

## Hosted using firebase
Hosting URL: https://angular-pwa-news.firebaseapp.com

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

To run production build on local, `npm install -g http-server`. Step into dist folder and start application in production mode:
`cd dist`
`http-server -c-1`

the -c-1 option will disable server caching and server will noramlly run on 8080 port serving the production version of application.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
